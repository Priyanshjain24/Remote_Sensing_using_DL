My project was Remote Sensing and Image Visualization Using Deep Learning (AERIAL IMAGERY SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION).

Task 1 was based on Week 1 material which had basic pyhon tutorials and some associated libraries.
I worked on the task between 30th April and 7th May and submitted it before the deadline.

Task 2 was based on the material of week 2-5 which had tutorials on machine learning models, Tensorflow/PyTorch and lectures on neural networks.
The task was given after the completion of week 5 and required no coding.
I worked on the task between 5th July and 11th July and submitted it before the deadline.

Task 3 aka. The Final Coding Assignment was an application of everything we had learnt so far.
We had to do Semantic segmentation and Classification of aerial imagery Using Deep Learning for a datdataset consisting of 72 aerial images of Dubai obtained by MBRSC 
satellites and annotated with pixel-wise semantic segmentation in 6 classes.
I worked on the assignment between 13th July and 22nd July and submiited it before the deadline.
